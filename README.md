# React Form Validate Application

This application implements various types of form validations and demonstrates how to manage form events efficiently using "Formik." It also utilizes "Yup" integrated with "Formik" for robust validation schemes. The files are componentized to avoid code repetition and improve code readability following clean code principles.

## About

In any system, there are validations both on the client-side and the server-side. In this application, we ensure that the information, which would potentially be sent to the server, complies with our requirements, preventing requests with invalid data.
